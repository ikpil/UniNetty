# UniNetty Project

*UniNetty is a port of [Azure/DotNetty](https://github.com/Azure/DotNetty), an asynchronous event-driven network framework designed for developing high-performance, maintainable protocol servers and clients, fully compatible with Unity3D.*  

*If you'd like to support the project, we'd appreciate starring(⭐) our repos on Github for more visibility.*

## 🚀 Features

- **Unity3D Compatibility** : Integrate DotNetty's functionality into Unity projects, simplifying the implementation of networking features.
- **Unified API for various transport types** : blocking and non-blocking socket
- **Flexible Event Model** : Based on a flexible and extensible event model which allows clear separation of concerns
- **Highly Customizable Thread Model** : single thread, one or more thread pools such as SEDA
- **Datagram Socket** : True connectionless datagram socket support

UniNetty is divided into multiple modules, each contained in its own folder:

- [UniNetty.Logging](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Logging) : Logging framework used internally by UniNetty
- [UniNetty.Common](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Common) : Provides utility functions and common components for asynchronous and concurrent operations.
- [UniNetty.Buffers](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Buffers) : Manages efficient memory allocation and deallocation for network data buffers.
- [UniNetty.Transport](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Transport) : Implements core TCP and UDP transport functionalities with scalable event loop support.
- [UniNetty.Codecs](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Codecs) : Handles encoding and decoding of data across network channels.
- [UniNetty.Codecs.Http](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Codecs.Http) : Supports HTTP/1.1 and handles full HTTP request/response lifecycle.
- [UniNetty.Codecs.Mqtt](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Codecs.Mqtt) : Implements MQTT protocol for IoT communication with efficient message handling.
- [UniNetty.Codecs.Protobuf](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Codecs.Protobuf) : Facilitates Protocol Buffers serialization and deserialization for compact binary communication.
- [UniNetty.Codecs.Redis](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Codecs.Redis) : Implements Redis protocol for building Redis-compatible servers or clients.
- [UniNetty.Handlers](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Runtime/UniNetty.Handlers) : Includes handlers for SSL/TLS, WebSocket, and other essential network features.
- [UniNetty.Examples](https://github.com/ikpil/UniNetty/tree/main/Examples) : Examples of usage
